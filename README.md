## Hi there 👋👋👋

My name is Nico, I am a Biomedical Engineer student at GMU with a concentration in Computational Biomechanics. I am interested in all things related to Biomedical Data Analytics, Finite Element Analysis, Computational Methods, Signal Processing and Filtering techniques. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [https://github.com/ngarci00/BENG_Senior-Design] which focuses on creating a Machine Learning Model to assess video-assisted endotracheal intubation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to utilize tools such as PyTorch and LabelMe to classify and label videos for the project above.
